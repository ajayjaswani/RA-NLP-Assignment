# RA-NLP-Assignment

Hi, This project is a Maven based java project that used Stanford COre NLP library to perform some operations. The src folder has to two java class files "Pipeline.java" and 
"Computations.java". The "Computations.java" file reads a Txt file(Document.txt) as input that contains some sentences, it then uses Core NLP library to perform below operations-

1) Counts the number of sentences in file(Document.txt) along with storing the sentences in an output file(Output.txt)
2) Counts the number of words in file(Document.txt) along with storing the words in an output file(Output.txt)
3) Counts the number of Nouns in file(Document.txt) along with storing the Nouns in an output file(Output.txt)
4) Sentiment of each sentence in the input file(Document.txt)

This is a backend only project.

For the frontend part i have created a very basic HTML file that takes input from user or from a file.
